The undergraduate degree in computer science (CS) offered by the College of Computing provides a solid foundation of knowledge and skills for applying digital processes effectively to issues of broad interest in a global society. Our program is based on a unique concept, Threads\u2122 , a significant College of Computing innovation in undergraduate CS education. The curriculum builds on a base of fundamentals in programming and computational theory to allow each student the opportunity to explore a variety of computing paths in depth. There are nine Threads, each providing a focused journey through a broad spectrum of course offerings at Georgia Tech in preparation for a distinctive future in a changing and interconnected world. Each student selects two Threads to fulfill the requirements for an accredited Bachelor of Science degree in computer science. It is at the intersection of the two paths that the unique synergistic value of this educational experience is realized. Graduates will leave the College of Computing fully aware of the limitless potential of their dynamic discipline and be able to adapt and continuously add value to society throughout their careers.  The Threads\u2122 represent partial paths through the curriculum. Thus, a student weaves a degree from these Threads. Students are not forced to make Thread decisions very early in their academic careers; however, they may if they want. We define the Threads so they are flexible enough to allow for a variety of technical and creative experiences. Threads are coherent enough that students develop computing skills even if their focus shifts as they go along.  The CS curriculum also offers opportunities in undergraduate research and international study. In addition to the standard four-year plan, a five-year cooperative plan is offered for students who wish to combine their academic education with industry experience.  The undergraduate program requires:  a total of 124 credit hours for graduation, plus a two-hour Wellness course. With the exception of free electives, all Bachelor of Science degree coursework must be taken on a letter-grade basis. Up to six hours of free electives may be taken on a pass\/fail basis. No 1000- or 2000-level HPS hours or precalculus hours (currently MATH\u00a01113) may be used as free electives. No course that covers the same material as other courses in a student's plan of study can be used as a free elective. All required CS courses, whether Thread or non-Thread, must be completed with a C or better to be counted toward degree requirements. All courses listed as required for a Thread, whether CS or non-CS, must be completed with a C or better to be counted toward degree requirements. The College of Computing Defines Nine Threads  A Thread provides an intuitive, flexible, and mutually strengthening set of courses that allows a student to craft a distinctive future in an area that is certain to have societal value in the emerging world. A Thread provides a skill and credential basis that allows graduates to create value in ways beyond what would be possible with only a narrowly focused tool set.  Choose any two threads to create your own path and special variation on an area of study.  Computing and Cybersecurity and Privacy: building security and privacy in computing systems to fortify them against attacks from malicious actors and other disruptions. Computing and Devices: creating devices embedded in physical objects that interact in the physical world Computing and Information Internetworks: representing, transforming, transmitting, and presenting information Computing and Intelligence: building top-to-bottom models of human-level intelligence Computing and Media: building systems in order to exploit computing's abilities to provide creative outlets Computing and Modeling - Simulation: representing natural and physical processes Computing and People: designing, building, and evaluating systems that treat the human as a central component Computing and Systems and Architecture : creating computer architectures, systems, and languages Computing and Theory: theoretical foundations underlying a wide range of computing disciplines  Threads\u2122 are defined as partial paths through the course offerings of the Institute. Students constructs their own personalized computer science degree by weaving through two Threads\u2122. Each Thread\u2122 is about 2\/3 of a degree, but with Thread\u2122 arithmetic, since there's so much overlap, 2\/3 + 2\/3 = 1. Each pair of Threads\u2122 fulfills the requirements for an accredited Bachelor of Science degree in computer science.  The Power of One Thread  Are you a computationalist who is interested in the expressive arts (telling stories, making games, creating emotional experiences)? Join the Computing and Media Thread. Here you'll see courses on topics ranging from computational graphics to Hamlet, from human perception to interactive fiction engines.  Are you a computationalist who is interested in placing intelligence in physical objects like robots, airplanes, or cell phones? Join the Computing and Devices Thread. Here you'll see courses on everything from computational sensors to dealing with noisy data, from real-time operating systems to mobile power issues and computational autonomy.  Weaving Two Threads Together - A Leap  Are you interested in computer security? Then perhaps choose Computing and Information to learn how data is stored, retrieved, encoded, transmitted, etc. And perhaps also choose Computing and People to learn how people use technology, how to run experiments with human subjects, etc. The kind of person you will become is the kind of person who will be able to invent and build secure systems that are usable by people.

The undergraduate degree in computer science (CS) offered by the College of Computing provides a solid foundation of knowledge and skills for applying digital processes effectively to issues of broad interest in a global society. Our program is based on a unique concept, Threads\u2122 , a significant College of Computing innovation in undergraduate CS education. The curriculum builds on a base of fundamentals in programming and computational theory to allow each student the opportunity to explore a variety of computing paths in depth. There are nine Threads, each providing a focused journey through a broad spectrum of course offerings at Georgia Tech in preparation for a distinctive future in a changing and interconnected world. Each student selects two Threads to fulfill the requirements for an accredited Bachelor of Science degree in computer science. It is at the intersection of the two paths that the unique synergistic value of this educational experience is realized. Graduates will leave the College of Computing fully aware of the limitless potential of their dynamic discipline and be able to adapt and continuously add value to society throughout their careers.  The Threads\u2122 represent partial paths through the curriculum. Thus, a student weaves a degree from these Threads. Students are not forced to make Thread decisions very early in their academic careers; however, they may if they want. We define the Threads so they are flexible enough to allow for a variety of technical and creative experiences. Threads are coherent enough that students develop computing skills even if their focus shifts as they go along.  The CS curriculum also offers opportunities in undergraduate research and international study. In addition to the standard four-year plan, a five-year cooperative plan is offered for students who wish to combine their academic education with industry experience.  The undergraduate program requires:  a total of 124 credit hours for graduation, plus a two-hour Wellness course. With the exception of free electives, all Bachelor of Science degree coursework must be taken on a letter-grade basis. Up to six hours of free electives may be taken on a pass\/fail basis. No 1000- or 2000-level HPS hours or precalculus hours (currently MATH\u00a01113) may be used as free electives. No course that covers the same material as other courses in a student's plan of study can be used as a free elective. All required CS courses, whether Thread or non-Thread, must be completed with a C or better to be counted toward degree requirements. All courses listed as required for a Thread, whether CS or non-CS, must be completed with a C or better to be counted toward degree requirements. The College of Computing Defines Nine Threads  A Thread provides an intuitive, flexible, and mutually strengthening set of courses that allows a student to craft a distinctive future in an area that is certain to have societal value in the emerging world. A Thread provides a skill and credential basis that allows graduates to create value in ways beyond what would be possible with only a narrowly focused tool set.  Choose any two threads to create your own path and special variation on an area of study.  Computing and Cybersecurity and Privacy: building security and privacy in computing systems to fortify them against attacks from malicious actors and other disruptions.

The undergraduate degree in computer science (CS) offered by the College of Computing provides a solid foundation of knowledge and skills for applying digital processes effectively to issues of broad interest in a global society. Our program is based on a unique concept, Threads\u2122 , a significant College of Computing innovation in undergraduate CS education. The curriculum builds on a base of fundamentals in programming and computational theory to allow each student the opportunity to explore a variety of computing paths in depth. There are nine Threads, each providing a focused journey through a broad spectrum of course offerings at Georgia Tech in preparation for a distinctive future in a changing and interconnected world. Each student selects two Threads to fulfill the requirements for an accredited Bachelor of Science degree in computer science. It is at the intersection of the two paths that the unique synergistic value of this educational experience is realized. Graduates will leave the College of Computing fully aware of the limitless potential of their dynamic discipline and be able to adapt and continuously add value to society throughout their careers.  The Threads\u2122 represent partial paths through the curriculum. Thus, a student weaves a degree from these Threads. Students are not forced to make Thread decisions very early in their academic careers; however, they may if they want. We define the Threads so they are flexible enough to allow for a variety of technical and creative experiences. Threads are coherent enough that students develop computing skills even if their focus shifts as they go along.  The CS curriculum also offers opportunities in undergraduate research and international study. In addition to the standard four-year plan, a five-year cooperative plan is offered for students who wish to combine their academic education with industry experience.  The undergraduate program requires:  a total of 124 credit hours for graduation, plus a two-hour Wellness course. With the exception of free electives, all Bachelor of Science degree coursework must be taken on a letter-grade basis. Up to six hours of free electives may be taken on a pass\/fail basis. No 1000- or 2000-level HPS hours or precalculus hours (currently MATH\u00a01113) may be used as free electives. No course that covers the same material as other courses in a student's plan of study can be used as a free elective. All required CS courses, whether Thread or non-Thread, must be completed with a C or better to be counted toward degree requirements. All courses listed as required for a Thread, whether CS or non-CS, must be completed with a C or better to be counted toward degree requirements. The College of Computing Defines Nine Threads  A Thread provides an intuitive, flexible, and mutually strengthening set of courses that allows a student to craft a distinctive future in an area that is certain to have societal value in the emerging world. A Thread provides a skill and credential basis that allows graduates to create value in ways beyond what would be possible with only a narrowly focused tool set.  Choose any two threads to create your own path and special variation on an area of study.  Computing and Cybersecurity and Privacy: building security and privacy in computing systems to fortify them against attacks from malicious actors and other disruptions. Computing and Devices: creating devices embedded in physical objects that interact in the physical world Computing and Information Internetworks: representing, transforming, transmitting, and presenting information Computing and Intelligence: building top-to-bottom models of human-level intelligence Computing and Media: building systems in order to exploit computing's abilities to provide creative outlets Computing and Modeling - Simulation: representing natural and physical processes Computing and People: designing, building, and evaluating systems that treat the human as a central component Computing and Systems and Architecture : creating computer architectures, systems, and languages Computing and Theory: theoretical foundations underlying a wide range of computing disciplines  Threads\u2122 are defined as partial paths through the course offerings of the Institute. Students constructs their own personalized computer science degree by weaving through two Threads\u2122. Each Thread\u2122 is about 2\/3 of a degree, but with Thread\u2122 arithmetic, since there's so much overlap, 2\/3 + 2\/3 = 1. Each pair of Threads\u2122 fulfills the requirements for an accredited Bachelor of Science degree in computer science.  The Power of One Thread  Are you a computationalist who is interested in the expressive arts (telling stories, making games, creating emotional experiences)? Join the Computing and Media Thread. Here you'll see courses on topics ranging from computational graphics to Hamlet, from human perception to interactive fiction engines.  Are you a computationalist who is interested in placing intelligence in physical objects like robots, airplanes, or cell phones? Join the Computing and Devices Thread.

There are nine Threads, each providing a focused journey through a broad spectrum of course offerings at Georgia Tech in preparation for a distinctive future in a changing and interconnected world. Each student selects two Threads to fulfill the requirements for an accredited Bachelor of Science degree in computer science. It is at the intersection of the two paths that the unique synergistic value of this educational experience is realized. Graduates will leave the College of Computing fully aware of the limitless potential of their dynamic discipline and be able to adapt and continuously add value to society throughout their careers.  The Threads\u2122 represent partial paths through the curriculum. Thus, a student weaves a degree from these Threads. Students are not forced to make Thread decisions very early in their academic careers; however, they may if they want. We define the Threads so they are flexible enough to allow for a variety of technical and creative experiences. Threads are coherent enough that students develop computing skills even if their focus shifts as they go along.  The CS curriculum also offers opportunities in undergraduate research and international study. In addition to the standard four-year plan, a five-year cooperative plan is offered for students who wish to combine their academic education with industry experience.  The undergraduate program requires:  a total of 124 credit hours for graduation, plus a two-hour Wellness course. With the exception of free electives, all Bachelor of Science degree coursework must be taken on a letter-grade basis. Up to six hours of free electives may be taken on a pass\/fail basis. No 1000- or 2000-level HPS hours or precalculus hours (currently MATH\u00a01113) may be used as free electives. No course that covers the same material as other courses in a student's plan of study can be used as a free elective. All required CS courses, whether Thread or non-Thread, must be completed with a C or better to be counted toward degree requirements. All courses listed as required for a Thread, whether CS or non-CS, must be completed with a C or better to be counted toward degree requirements. The College of Computing Defines Nine Threads  A Thread provides an intuitive, flexible, and mutually strengthening set of courses that allows a student to craft a distinctive future in an area that is certain to have societal value in the emerging world. A Thread provides a skill and credential basis that allows graduates to create value in ways beyond what would be possible with only a narrowly focused tool set.  Choose any two threads to create your own path and special variation on an area of study.  Computing and Cybersecurity and Privacy: building security and privacy in computing systems to fortify them against attacks from malicious actors and other disruptions. Computing and Devices: creating devices embedded in physical objects that interact in the physical world Computing and Information Internetworks: representing, transforming, transmitting, and presenting information Computing and Intelligence: building top-to-bottom models of human-level intelligence Computing and Media: building systems in order to exploit computing's abilities to provide creative outlets Computing and Modeling - Simulation: representing natural and physical processes Computing and People: designing, building, and evaluating systems that treat the human as a central component Computing and Systems and Architecture : creating computer architectures, systems, and languages Computing and Theory: theoretical foundations underlying a wide range of computing disciplines  Threads\u2122 are defined as partial paths through the course offerings of the Institute. Students constructs their own personalized computer science degree by weaving through two Threads\u2122. Each Thread\u2122 is about 2\/3 of a degree, but with Thread\u2122 arithmetic, since there's so much overlap, 2\/3 + 2\/3 = 1. Each pair of Threads\u2122 fulfills the requirements for an accredited Bachelor of Science degree in computer science.  The Power of One Thread  Are you a computationalist who is interested in the expressive arts (telling stories, making games, creating emotional experiences)? Join the Computing and Media Thread. Here you'll see courses on topics ranging from computational graphics to Hamlet, from human perception to interactive fiction engines.  Are you a computationalist who is interested in placing intelligence in physical objects like robots, airplanes, or cell phones? Join the Computing and Devices Thread. Here you'll see courses on everything from computational sensors to dealing with noisy data, from real-time operating systems to mobile power issues and computational autonomy.  Weaving Two Threads Together - A Leap  Are you interested in computer security? Then perhaps choose Computing and Information to learn how data is stored, retrieved, encoded, transmitted, etc. And perhaps also choose Computing and People to learn how people use technology, how to run experiments with human subjects, etc. The kind of person you will become is the kind of person who will be able to invent and build secure systems that are usable by people.

The undergraduate program requires:  a total of 124 credit hours for graduation, plus a two-hour Wellness course. With the exception of free electives, all Bachelor of Science degree coursework must be taken on a letter-grade basis. Up to six hours of free electives may be taken on a pass\/fail basis. No 1000- or 2000-level HPS hours or precalculus hours (currently MATH\u00a01113) may be used as free electives. No course that covers the same material as other courses in a student's plan of study can be used as a free elective. All required CS courses, whether Thread or non-Thread, must be completed with a C or better to be counted toward degree requirements. All courses listed as required for a Thread, whether CS or non-CS, must be completed with a C or better to be counted toward degree requirements. The College of Computing Defines Nine Threads  A Thread provides an intuitive, flexible, and mutually strengthening set of courses that allows a student to craft a distinctive future in an area that is certain to have societal value in the emerging world. A Thread provides a skill and credential basis that allows graduates to create value in ways beyond what would be possible with only a narrowly focused tool set.  Choose any two threads to create your own path and special variation on an area of study.  Computing and Cybersecurity and Privacy: building security and privacy in computing systems to fortify them against attacks from malicious actors and other disruptions. Computing and Devices: creating devices embedded in physical objects that interact in the physical world Computing and Information Internetworks: representing, transforming, transmitting, and presenting information Computing and Intelligence: building top-to-bottom models of human-level intelligence Computing and Media: building systems in order to exploit computing's abilities to provide creative outlets Computing and Modeling - Simulation: representing natural and physical processes Computing and People: designing, building, and evaluating systems that treat the human as a central component Computing and Systems and Architecture : creating computer architectures, systems, and languages Computing and Theory: theoretical foundations underlying a wide range of computing disciplines  Threads\u2122 are defined as partial paths through the course offerings of the Institute. Students constructs their own personalized computer science degree by weaving through two Threads\u2122. Each Thread\u2122 is about 2\/3 of a degree, but with Thread\u2122 arithmetic, since there's so much overlap, 2\/3 + 2\/3 = 1. Each pair of Threads\u2122 fulfills the requirements for an accredited Bachelor of Science degree in computer science.  The Power of One Thread  Are you a computationalist who is interested in the expressive arts (telling stories, making games, creating emotional experiences)? Join the Computing and Media Thread. Here you'll see courses on topics ranging from computational graphics to Hamlet, from human perception to interactive fiction engines.  Are you a computationalist who is interested in placing intelligence in physical objects like robots, airplanes, or cell phones? Join the Computing and Devices Thread. Here you'll see courses on everything from computational sensors to dealing with noisy data, from real-time operating systems to mobile power issues and computational autonomy.  Weaving Two Threads Together - A Leap  Are you interested in computer security? Then perhaps choose Computing and Information to learn how data is stored, retrieved, encoded, transmitted, etc. And perhaps also choose Computing and People to learn how people use technology, how to run experiments with human subjects, etc. The kind of person you will become is the kind of person who will be able to invent and build secure systems that are usable by people.

The undergraduate degree in computer science (CS) offered by the College of Computing provides a solid foundation of knowledge and skills for applying digital processes effectively to issues of broad interest in a global society. Our program is based on a unique concept, Threads\u2122 , a significant College of Computing innovation in undergraduate CS education. The curriculum builds on a base of fundamentals in programming and computational theory to allow each student the opportunity to explore a variety of computing paths in depth. There are nine Threads, each providing a focused journey through a broad spectrum of course offerings at Georgia Tech in preparation for a distinctive future in a changing and interconnected world. Each student selects two Threads to fulfill the requirements for an accredited Bachelor of Science degree in computer science. It is at the intersection of the two paths that the unique synergistic value of this educational experience is realized. Graduates will leave the College of Computing fully aware of the limitless potential of their dynamic discipline and be able to adapt and continuously add value to society throughout their careers.  The Threads\u2122 represent partial paths through the curriculum. Thus, a student weaves a degree from these Threads. Students are not forced to make Thread decisions very early in their academic careers; however, they may if they want. We define the Threads so they are flexible enough to allow for a variety of technical and creative experiences. Threads are coherent enough that students develop computing skills even if their focus shifts as they go along.  The CS curriculum also offers opportunities in undergraduate research and international study. In addition to the standard four-year plan, a five-year cooperative plan is offered for students who wish to combine their academic education with industry experience.  The undergraduate program requires:  a total of 124 credit hours for graduation, plus a two-hour Wellness course. With the exception of free electives, all Bachelor of Science degree coursework must be taken on a letter-grade basis. Up to six hours of free electives may be taken on a pass\/fail basis. No 1000- or 2000-level HPS hours or precalculus hours (currently MATH\u00a01113) may be used as free electives. No course that covers the same material as other courses in a student's plan of study can be used as a free elective. All required CS courses, whether Thread or non-Thread, must be completed with a C or better to be counted toward degree requirements. All courses listed as required for a Thread, whether CS or non-CS, must be completed with a C or better to be counted toward degree requirements. The College of Computing Defines Nine Threads  A Thread provides an intuitive, flexible, and mutually strengthening set of courses that allows a student to craft a distinctive future in an area that is certain to have societal value in the emerging world. A Thread provides a skill and credential basis that allows graduates to create value in ways beyond what would be possible with only a narrowly focused tool set.  Choose any two threads to create your own path and special variation on an area of study.  Computing and Cybersecurity and Privacy: building security and privacy in computing systems to fortify them against attacks from malicious actors and other disruptions. Computing and Devices: creating devices embedded in physical objects that interact in the physical world Computing and Information Internetworks: representing, transforming, transmitting, and presenting information Computing and Intelligence: building top-to-bottom models of human-level intelligence Computing and Media: building systems in order to exploit computing's abilities to provide creative outlets Computing and Modeling - Simulation: representing natural and physical processes Computing and People: designing, building, and evaluating systems that treat the human as a central component Computing and Systems and Architecture : creating computer architectures, systems, and languages Computing and Theory: theoretical foundations underlying a wide range of computing disciplines  Threads\u2122 are defined as partial paths through the course offerings of the Institute.

Graduates receive the MSCS for completing one of three options in the program as described in this section. Students may apply to the program if they possess a bachelor's degree in computer science from an accredited institution. Students without a bachelor's degree in computer science are encouraged to apply as well, with the understanding that they will be required to complete remedial coursework appropriate to their background in addition to the requirements of the MSCS degree. All applicants are evaluated according to their prior academic record, scores on the Graduate Record Examination, a personal statement, and letters of recommendation. Applicants are selected for fall semester admission only. The application deadline is February 1. However, all applicants are encouraged to apply as early as possible because the selection process may begin well before the deadline.  Students entering the program must demonstrate a core competency in computing equivalent to undergraduate-level courses in the following areas:  systems, design and analysis of algorithms, formal languages and automata theory, databases, networking and communications, computer architecture, and human-computer interaction.  This requirement can be satisfied by having taken undergraduate courses as a part of an undergraduate degree, taking remedial courses in the MS CS program, or by examination. Students may specialize in areas of their choice. Every student must complete at least one specialization as a part of their degree program. The current eleven specialization areas are:  Computer Graphics, Computing Systems  High-Performance Computing, Human-Computer Interaction  Interactive Intelligence  Machine Learning  Modeling and Simulations  Scientific Computing  Social Computing  Visual Analytics.  A student who is enrolled in another graduate program of the Institute may pursue an MSCS while that student is also pursuing their degree in the other major. To be granted permission to pursue the MSCS, a student must submit to the MS program coordinator of the College of Computing the material required for admission to the MSCS program. This includes transcripts, letters of recommendation, and GRE General Test. If the student is approved by the College to pursue the MSCS, the student will be notified in writing. At no time will a student outside the College be allowed to pursue a concurrent degree without prior permission of the MS program coordinator of the College of Computing.  A student enrolled in the MS degree program in computer science who wishes to be admitted to the PhD program in computer science should apply via the same process as external students. It is expected that such a student will have at least two letters of recommendation from College of Computing faculty.
