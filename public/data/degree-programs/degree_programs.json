    "overview": "Department website: http://www.aco.gatech.edu/  One of the most rapidly growing areas of research in applied mathematics, computer science, and operations research has been dealing with discrete structures. This has been most evident in the fields of combinatorics, discrete optimization, and the analysis of algorithms. Increasingly, work in each of these subjects has come to depend on knowledge of all of them. Indeed, many of the most significant advances have resulted from the efforts of researchers in more than one, if not all three, of these areas.  In response to these developments, Georgia Tech has introduced a doctoral degree program in Algorithms, Combinatorics, and Optimization (ACO). This multidisciplinary program is sponsored jointly by the School of Mathematics, the School of Industrial and Systems Engineering, and the College of Computing. Faculty for the program are drawn from these three sponsoring units, as well as from the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering and the College of Business.  The ACO program is arranged to bring together the study of discrete structures and the design and analysis of algorithms in areas such as graph theory, integer programming, combinatorial optimization, and polyhedral theory. It is intended for students possessing a strong background in one or more of the fields represented by the three sponsoring units. Each student in the program has a single home department chosen from the School of Mathematics, the School of Industrial and Systems Engineering, and the College of Computing. Courses for the program are drawn from all three of these units, and include study in such areas as combinatorial methods, algebraic structures, probability, the analysis of algorithms, computational complexity, linear programming, discrete optimization, and convex analysis.  The College of Computing is one of the sponsors of the multidisciplinary program in Algorithms, Combinatorics, and Optimization (ACO), an approved doctoral degree program at Georgia Tech. The other sponsoring units are the Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering and the School of Mathematics. The degree program is administered by an oversight committee drawn primarily from the sponsoring units.  The study of discrete structures is a rapidly growing area in computer science, applied mathematics, and operations research, most obviously in the analysis of algorithms, combinatorics, and discrete optimization. Collaborative work among the three traditionally separate disciplines is already common. The doctorate in Algorithms, Combinatorics, and Optimization will prepare students for careers in this exciting and expanding field.  Students are expected to be well prepared in at least one of the three fields represented by the sponsoring units (computer science, mathematics, and operations research). Each student in the program is admitted through one of the three sponsoring units, which serves as the home department. Coursework is drawn from all three disciplines. The research advisor may be any member of the ACO program faculty, which is drawn from electrical and computer engineering, management, and other disciplines in addition to the three sponsoring units.

    "overview": "The School of Physics offers two undergraduate degrees, the Bachelor of Science in Physics and the Bachelor of Science in Applied Physics.  The degree program in applied physics may be better suited for entry into industry or government upon graduation, preparation for further professional training (medicine, law, dentistry, or business), or preparation for graduate study in some other discipline. The applied physics program differs from the traditional one in that a few courses intended primarily as preparation for graduate study in physics are replaced by courses oriented toward the applications of physics.  Each of the baccalaureate programs contains the following: a) courses needed to meet general institutional degree requirements; b) a core of technical courses intended to give a strong background in mathematics and the physical principles of mechanics, electricity and magnetism, thermodynamics, and the quantum theory that governs physical phenomena at the microscopic level of molecules, atoms, and nuclei; c) technical electives that enable the student to explore areas of their choice in greater depth; d) courses involving undergraduate research, and e) free electives, about fifteen percent of the total hours, which may be employed to schedule additional technical or nontechnical courses.  The considerable flexibility inherent in the physics curricula is advantageous to students who wish to work out individual programs of study. At the same time, this flexibility suggests the need for consultation with advisors so students can make the best use of elective hours and avoid scheduling difficulties that may arise in later semesters. Students may utilize their elective freedom in the physics curricula to specialize in particular areas of physics, to prepare for careers in interdisciplinary areas of science, to compose a preprofessional program, or to gain a background in other technical or nontechnical disciplines. Students should contact their academic advisor for assistance in planning programs of study with emphasis directed toward a particular objective.  Since some students who earn a degree in physics have transferred from other disciplines, the School has planned its degree programs to enable most students to transfer into physics with little or no loss of credit.  A total of 120 credit hours (exclusive of wellness) and a grade-point average of at least 2.0 in physics courses numbered 3000 and higher are requisites for the bachelor's degree in physics.

Fully accredited by the National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB), this degree option provides flexibility for students who have an undergraduate degree with a major in architecture as well as those with a degree in a field other than architecture. The M.Arch. Program requires a minimum of 60 credit hours and a maximum of 102 credit hours of study, depending upon the applicant's prior education in architecture and the amount of advanced standing credit granted upon admission to the program. Please note: Successful completion of the Master of Architecture requires a minimum grade of C in all courses. Advanced standing credit is only granted for courses in which the student received a grade of A or B.  Normally, a student admitted to the program with maximum advanced standing can expect to complete the program within two academic years of full-time study. A student admitted to the program with no advanced standing can expect the program to require three and one-half academic years of full-time study. Graduates from four-year undergraduate programs in architecture similar to that at Georgia Tech can normally expect to complete the program in two academic years, provided they have pursued architecturally related elective coursework during their undergraduate years. Specific information regarding applications for advanced standing and degree requirements is available from the School of Architecture.  Multidisciplinary studies are strongly encouraged in all of the master's programs in architecture. These studies may be part of a formal dual degree program, including architecture and city and regional planning. Other multidisciplinary studies are possible within the College of Design, the Institute, or at other Atlanta area colleges and universities, such as Emory University and Georgia State University. Coursework outside the School of Architecture frequently includes city and regional planning, public policy, history, philosophy, real estate development, engineering, and studio art.

    "overview": "The program leading to the Doctor of Philosophy degree in the College of Design has been developed to enable students of exceptional ability to undertake advanced study and original research in the fields of study within the College of Design. Currently the program includes several areas of research emphasis:  Design Computation Building Design Technology History, Theory, Criticism Architecture, Culture and Behavior Urbanism Design Computation  Digital-based information technologies have profoundly affected architectural discourse and practice. New types of representation and manufacturing, emergent materials and technologies, innovating modes of collaboration and project delivery, all constitute a profoundly new discourse that has revolutionized the ways architects design, think and talk about architecture, design and buildings. The Design Computation area addresses this emergent all encompassing computational basis for architectural design by inquiring on a variety of related sub-areas including generative and parametric design, digital fabrication, prototyping and robotics, building information modeling (BIM), immersive visualization and virtual reality, databases and user interfaces, formal specification of shape and style, and computer implementation of analytical and design tools. The work draws upon relations with other disciplines at Georgia Tech including allied fields within the College of Design as well as the Colleges of Computing, Engineering, Sciences, Business, and the Liberal Arts.  Building Design Technology  The Ph.D. specialization in Building Design Technology, advances the use of building physics, building technology, mathematics, controls, modeling, and simulation for the design and operation of high-performing buildings. The technical performance of buildings is the result of the complex interplay of highly variable boundary conditions with the physical behavior of many components operating in multiple domains. The capture of this interplay at appropriate resolution and aggregation with subsequent use in design and operational decisions is the major focus of our work. Research results generate new building performance knowledge in fields such as energy, sustainability, comfort, health, day-lighting, productivity and other performance aspects.  History, Theory, Criticism  The Ph.D. specialization in Architecture History, Theory, Criticism, promotes critical and\u00a0scholarly reflection in architecture and urban design, with a special focus on issues\u00a0linking theory and practice. Ongoing work extends a distinguished record of faculty\u00a0and alumni scholarship in the field based upon the unique range of disciplines and\u00a0professions available within the College of Design and Georgia Tech. While\u00a0highlighting modern and contemporary architecture, faculty interests vary\u00a0significantly by subject area, period, region, and methodological emphasis. These\u00a0continuously evolving interests are dedicated to understanding the built\u00a0environment as a form of cultural production. In different ways and with various\u00a0techniques, faculty contribute to a growing field of cross-cultural studies and\u00a0interdisciplinary scholarship that use rigorous concepts from humanistic, social\u00a0scientific, and technical disciplines often considered to be outside the purview of\u00a0architectural history and theory, to better understand the material, spatial, and\u00a0intellectual dimensions of the physical world.  Architecture, Culture,\u00a0 Behavior  The field of Architecture, Culture, Behavior,\u00a0 explores how individual, social, organizational, and cultural behavior, performance, and experience relate to the design of buildings and urban space. We develop tools and methods to describe and quantify the properties of built form, model performance and evaluate design and their impacts on individual experience and organizational functioning. Underlying themes of inquiry include spatial cognition; the relationship between built space and social networks; the relationship between built space and the morphology of behaviors; the evolution of building types in relation to the changing programmatic requirements of their occupant organizations; the perceptual and functional implications of design languages. \u00a0Particular studies explore a range of built environments: healthcare facilities that support higher quality care; workplace design that supports organizational culture and productivity; museum design that supports informal learning; urban design that supports active and vibrant communities. \u00a0  Urbanism  Research into Urbanism seeks to understand how we shape our cities to provide the highest quality of life, share resources equitably, promote ecological performance and address unprecedented 21st century challenges. Highly collaborative researchers in urbanism partner with sponsors around the planet and colleagues across Georgia Tech - especially those in the School of Civil and Environmental Engineering and School of City and Regional Planning.

    "overview": "The Bachelor of Science in Computational Media is a collaborative effort by the College of Computing, the School of Literature, Media, and Communication (LMC), and the School of Music. The program offers a thorough education in all aspects of the computer as a medium: the technical, the historical-critical, and the applied. Program graduates will have both significant hands-on and theoretical knowledge of computing and an understanding of visual design and the history of media. Graduates will be uniquely positioned to plan, create, and critique new digital media forms for entertainment, education, and business communication.  The program requires 36 credit hours of courses in computer science and 30 credit hours of courses in Music Technology or LMC (in addition to the humanities requirement). A substantial number of required courses in each unit ensures that every student has basic competence in:  computational principles; the representation and manipulation of digital media, including graphics and sound; software design; visual and interactive design; digital arts; and media theory and history.  After completing required courses, students specialize in a specific area of media computing. Typical specialty areas include:  Interactive games design: This is one of the fastest growing areas of digital media production and is already a $7 billion industry. Special effects: As special effects become more complex and focused on computer-generated imagery, employment in this area will increasingly require expertise in both media and computer science. Culturally informed program design: As programming work is increasingly outsourced to nations offering lower labor costs, programming that adds value through a sophisticated response to the needs of specific corporate and group cultures will offer job security to American programmers.  Depending on their coursework within the BS program, students will also be qualified to enter graduate studies in computer science, digital arts, digital media studies, and human-computer interface.",

    "overview": "Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with Threads  Focus: building on a base of fundamentals in programming and computational theory to provide a solid foundation of knowledge and skills for applying digital processes effectively to issues of broad interest in a global society.  The undergraduate degree in computer science (CS) offered by the College of Computing provides a solid foundation of knowledge and skills for applying digital processes effectively to issues of broad interest in a global society. Our program is based on a unique concept, Threads\u2122 , a significant College of Computing innovation in undergraduate CS education. The curriculum builds on a base of fundamentals in programming and computational theory to allow each student the opportunity to explore a variety of computing paths in depth. There are nine Threads, each providing a focused journey through a broad spectrum of course offerings at Georgia Tech in preparation for a distinctive future in a changing and interconnected world. Each student selects two Threads to fulfill the requirements for an accredited Bachelor of Science degree in computer science. It is at the intersection of the two paths that the unique synergistic value of this educational experience is realized. Graduates will leave the College of Computing fully aware of the limitless potential of their dynamic discipline and be able to adapt and continuously add value to society throughout their careers.  The Threads\u2122 represent partial paths through the curriculum. Thus, a student weaves a degree from these Threads. Students are not forced to make Thread decisions very early in their academic careers; however, they may if they want. We define the Threads so they are flexible enough to allow for a variety of technical and creative experiences. Threads are coherent enough that students develop computing skills even if their focus shifts as they go along.  The CS curriculum also offers opportunities in undergraduate research and international study. In addition to the standard four-year plan, a five-year cooperative plan is offered for students who wish to combine their academic education with industry experience.  The undergraduate program requires:  a total of 124 credit hours for graduation, plus a two-hour Wellness course. With the exception of free electives, all Bachelor of Science degree coursework must be taken on a letter-grade basis. Up to six hours of free electives may be taken on a pass/fail basis. No 1000- or 2000-level HPS hours or precalculus hours (currently MATH\u00a01113) may be used as free electives. No course that covers the same material as other courses in a student's plan of study can be used as a free elective. All required CS courses, whether Thread or non-Thread, must be completed with a C or better to be counted toward degree requirements. All courses listed as required for a Thread, whether CS or non-CS, must be completed with a C or better to be counted toward degree requirements. The College of Computing Defines Nine Threads  A Thread provides an intuitive, flexible, and mutually strengthening set of courses that allows a student to craft a distinctive future in an area that is certain to have societal value in the emerging world. A Thread provides a skill and credential basis that allows graduates to create value in ways beyond what would be possible with only a narrowly focused tool set.  Choose any two threads to create your own path and special variation on an area of study.  Computing and Cybersecurity and Privacy: building security and privacy in computing systems to fortify them against attacks from malicious actors and other disruptions. Computing and Devices: creating devices embedded in physical objects that interact in the physical world Computing and Information Internetworks: representing, transforming, transmitting, and presenting information Computing and Intelligence: building top-to-bottom models of human-level intelligence Computing and Media: building systems in order to exploit computing's abilities to provide creative outlets Computing and Modeling - Simulation: representing natural and physical processes Computing and People: designing, building, and evaluating systems that treat the human as a central component Computing and Systems and Architecture : creating computer architectures, systems, and languages Computing and Theory: theoretical foundations underlying a wide range of computing disciplines  Threads\u2122 are defined as partial paths through the course offerings of the Institute. Students constructs their own personalized computer science degree by weaving through two Threads\u2122. Each Thread\u2122 is about 2/3 of a degree, but with Thread\u2122 arithmetic, since there's so much overlap, 2/3 + 2/3 = 1. Each pair of Threads\u2122 fulfills the requirements for an accredited Bachelor of Science degree in computer science.  The Power of One Thread  Are you a computationalist who is interested in the expressive arts (telling stories, making games, creating emotional experiences)? Join the Computing and Media Thread. Here you'll see courses on topics ranging from computational graphics to Hamlet, from human perception to interactive fiction engines.  Are you a computationalist who is interested in placing intelligence in physical objects like robots, airplanes, or cell phones? Join the Computing and Devices Thread. Here you'll see courses on everything from computational sensors to dealing with noisy data, from real-time operating systems to mobile power issues and computational autonomy.  Weaving Two Threads Together - A Leap  Are you interested in computer security? Then perhaps choose Computing and Information to learn how data is stored, retrieved, encoded, transmitted, etc. And perhaps also choose Computing and People to learn how people use technology, how to run experiments with human subjects, etc. The kind of person you will become is the kind of person who will be able to invent and build secure systems that are usable by people.

    "overview": "Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with Threads  Focus: building on a base of fundamentals in programming and computational theory to provide a solid foundation of knowledge and skills for applying digital processes effectively to issues of broad interest in a global society.  The undergraduate degree in computer science (CS) offered by the College of Computing provides a solid foundation of knowledge and skills for applying digital processes effectively to issues of broad interest in a global society. Our program is based on a unique concept, Threads\u2122 , a significant College of Computing innovation in undergraduate CS education. The curriculum builds on a base of fundamentals in programming and computational theory to allow each student the opportunity to explore a variety of computing paths in depth. There are nine Threads, each providing a focused journey through a broad spectrum of course offerings at Georgia Tech in preparation for a distinctive future in a changing and interconnected world. Each student selects two Threads to fulfill the requirements for an accredited Bachelor of Science degree in computer science. It is at the intersection of the two paths that the unique synergistic value of this educational experience is realized. Graduates will leave the College of Computing fully aware of the limitless potential of their dynamic discipline and be able to adapt and continuously add value to society throughout their careers.  The Threads\u2122 represent partial paths through the curriculum. Thus, a student weaves a degree from these Threads. Students are not forced to make Thread decisions very early in their academic careers; however, they may if they want. We define the Threads so they are flexible enough to allow for a variety of technical and creative experiences. Threads are coherent enough that students develop computing skills even if their focus shifts as they go along.  The CS curriculum also offers opportunities in undergraduate research and international study. In addition to the standard four-year plan, a five-year cooperative plan is offered for students who wish to combine their academic education with industry experience.  The undergraduate program requires:  a total of 124 credit hours for graduation, plus a two-hour Wellness course. With the exception of free electives, all Bachelor of Science degree coursework must be taken on a letter-grade basis. Up to six hours of free electives may be taken on a pass/fail basis. No 1000- or 2000-level HPS hours or precalculus hours (currently MATH\u00a01113) may be used as free electives. No course that covers the same material as other courses in a student's plan of study can be used as a free elective. All required CS courses, whether Thread or non-Thread, must be completed with a C or better to be counted toward degree requirements. All courses listed as required for a Thread, whether CS or non-CS, must be completed with a C or better to be counted toward degree requirements. The College of Computing Defines Nine Threads  A Thread provides an intuitive, flexible, and mutually strengthening set of courses that allows a student to craft a distinctive future in an area that is certain to have societal value in the emerging world. A Thread provides a skill and credential basis that allows graduates to create value in ways beyond what would be possible with only a narrowly focused tool set.  Choose any two threads to create your own path and special variation on an area of study.  Computing and Cybersecurity and Privacy: building security and privacy in computing systems to fortify them against attacks from malicious actors and other disruptions. Computing and Devices: creating devices embedded in physical objects that interact in the physical world Computing and Information Internetworks: representing, transforming, transmitting, and presenting information Computing and Intelligence: building top-to-bottom models of human-level intelligence Computing and Media: building systems in order to exploit computing's abilities to provide creative outlets Computing and Modeling - Simulation: representing natural and physical processes Computing and People: designing, building, and evaluating systems that treat the human as a central component Computing and Systems and Architecture : creating computer architectures, systems, and languages Computing and Theory: theoretical foundations underlying a wide range of computing disciplines  Threads\u2122 are defined as partial paths through the course offerings of the Institute.

    "overview": "Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with Threads  Focus: building on a base of fundamentals in programming and computational theory to provide a solid foundation of knowledge and skills for applying digital processes effectively to issues of broad interest in a global society.  The undergraduate degree in computer science (CS) offered by the College of Computing provides a solid foundation of knowledge and skills for applying digital processes effectively to issues of broad interest in a global society. Our program is based on a unique concept, Threads\u2122 , a significant College of Computing innovation in undergraduate CS education. The curriculum builds on a base of fundamentals in programming and computational theory to allow each student the opportunity to explore a variety of computing paths in depth. There are nine Threads, each providing a focused journey through a broad spectrum of course offerings at Georgia Tech in preparation for a distinctive future in a changing and interconnected world. Each student selects two Threads to fulfill the requirements for an accredited Bachelor of Science degree in computer science. It is at the intersection of the two paths that the unique synergistic value of this educational experience is realized. Graduates will leave the College of Computing fully aware of the limitless potential of their dynamic discipline and be able to adapt and continuously add value to society throughout their careers.  The Threads\u2122 represent partial paths through the curriculum. Thus, a student weaves a degree from these Threads. Students are not forced to make Thread decisions very early in their academic careers; however, they may if they want. We define the Threads so they are flexible enough to allow for a variety of technical and creative experiences. Threads are coherent enough that students develop computing skills even if their focus shifts as they go along.  The CS curriculum also offers opportunities in undergraduate research and international study. In addition to the standard four-year plan, a five-year cooperative plan is offered for students who wish to combine their academic education with industry experience.  The undergraduate program requires:  a total of 124 credit hours for graduation, plus a two-hour Wellness course. With the exception of free electives, all Bachelor of Science degree coursework must be taken on a letter-grade basis. Up to six hours of free electives may be taken on a pass/fail basis. No 1000- or 2000-level HPS hours or precalculus hours (currently MATH\u00a01113) may be used as free electives. No course that covers the same material as other courses in a student's plan of study can be used as a free elective. All required CS courses, whether Thread or non-Thread, must be completed with a C or better to be counted toward degree requirements. All courses listed as required for a Thread, whether CS or non-CS, must be completed with a C or better to be counted toward degree requirements. The College of Computing Defines Nine Threads  A Thread provides an intuitive, flexible, and mutually strengthening set of courses that allows a student to craft a distinctive future in an area that is certain to have societal value in the emerging world. A Thread provides a skill and credential basis that allows graduates to create value in ways beyond what would be possible with only a narrowly focused tool set.  Choose any two threads to create your own path and special variation on an area of study.  Computing and Cybersecurity and Privacy: building security and privacy in computing systems to fortify them against attacks from malicious actors and other disruptions. Computing and Devices: creating devices embedded in physical objects that interact in the physical world Computing and Information Internetworks: representing, transforming, transmitting, and presenting information Computing and Intelligence: building top-to-bottom models of human-level intelligence Computing and Media: building systems in order to exploit computing's abilities to provide creative outlets Computing and Modeling - Simulation: representing natural and physical processes Computing and People: designing, building, and evaluating systems that treat the human as a central component Computing and Systems and Architecture : creating computer architectures, systems, and languages Computing and Theory: theoretical foundations underlying a wide range of computing disciplines  Threads\u2122 are defined as partial paths through the course offerings of the Institute.

    "overview": "Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with Threads  Focus: building on a base of fundamentals in programming and computational theory to provide a solid foundation of knowledge and skills for applying digital processes effectively to issues of broad interest in a global society.  The undergraduate degree in computer science (CS) offered by the College of Computing provides a solid foundation of knowledge and skills for applying digital processes effectively to issues of broad interest in a global society. Our program is based on a unique concept, Threads\u2122 , a significant College of Computing innovation in undergraduate CS education. The curriculum builds on a base of fundamentals in programming and computational theory to allow each student the opportunity to explore a variety of computing paths in depth. There are nine Threads, each providing a focused journey through a broad spectrum of course offerings at Georgia Tech in preparation for a distinctive future in a changing and interconnected world. Each student selects two Threads to fulfill the requirements for an accredited Bachelor of Science degree in computer science. It is at the intersection of the two paths that the unique synergistic value of this educational experience is realized. Graduates will leave the College of Computing fully aware of the limitless potential of their dynamic discipline and be able to adapt and continuously add value to society throughout their careers.  The Threads\u2122 represent partial paths through the curriculum. Thus, a student weaves a degree from these Threads. Students are not forced to make Thread decisions very early in their academic careers; however, they may if they want. We define the Threads so they are flexible enough to allow for a variety of technical and creative experiences. Threads are coherent enough that students develop computing skills even if their focus shifts as they go along.  The CS curriculum also offers opportunities in undergraduate research and international study. In addition to the standard four-year plan, a five-year cooperative plan is offered for students who wish to combine their academic education with industry experience.  The undergraduate program requires:  a total of 124 credit hours for graduation, plus a two-hour Wellness course. With the exception of free electives, all Bachelor of Science degree coursework must be taken on a letter-grade basis. Up to six hours of free electives may be taken on a pass/fail basis. No 1000- or 2000-level HPS hours or precalculus hours (currently MATH\u00a01113) may be used as free electives. No course that covers the same material as other courses in a student's plan of study can be used as a free elective. All required CS courses, whether Thread or non-Thread, must be completed with a C or better to be counted toward degree requirements. All courses listed as required for a Thread, whether CS or non-CS, must be completed with a C or better to be counted toward degree requirements. The College of Computing Defines Nine Threads  A Thread provides an intuitive, flexible, and mutually strengthening set of courses that allows a student to craft a distinctive future in an area that is certain to have societal value in the emerging world. A Thread provides a skill and credential basis that allows graduates to create value in ways beyond what would be possible with only a narrowly focused tool set.  Choose any two threads to create your own path and special variation on an area of study.  Computing and Cybersecurity and Privacy: building security and privacy in computing systems to fortify them against attacks from malicious actors and other disruptions. Computing and Devices: creating devices embedded in physical objects that interact in the physical world Computing and Information Internetworks: representing, transforming, transmitting, and presenting information Computing and Intelligence: building top-to-bottom models of human-level intelligence Computing and Media: building systems in order to exploit computing's abilities to provide creative outlets Computing and Modeling - Simulation: representing natural and physical processes Computing and People: designing, building, and evaluating systems that treat the human as a central component Computing and Systems and Architecture : creating computer architectures, systems, and languages Computing and Theory: theoretical foundations underlying a wide range of computing disciplines  Threads\u2122 are defined as partial paths through the course offerings of the Institute.

    "overview": "Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with Threads  Focus: building on a base of fundamentals in programming and computational theory to provide a solid foundation of knowledge and skills for applying digital processes effectively to issues of broad interest in a global society.  The undergraduate degree in computer science (CS) offered by the College of Computing provides a solid foundation of knowledge and skills for applying digital processes effectively to issues of broad interest in a global society. Our program is based on a unique concept, Threads\u2122 , a significant College of Computing innovation in undergraduate CS education. The curriculum builds on a base of fundamentals in programming and computational theory to allow each student the opportunity to explore a variety of computing paths in depth. There are nine Threads, each providing a focused journey through a broad spectrum of course offerings at Georgia Tech in preparation for a distinctive future in a changing and interconnected world. Each student selects two Threads to fulfill the requirements for an accredited Bachelor of Science degree in computer science. It is at the intersection of the two paths that the unique synergistic value of this educational experience is realized. Graduates will leave the College of Computing fully aware of the limitless potential of their dynamic discipline and be able to adapt and continuously add value to society throughout their careers.  The Threads\u2122 represent partial paths through the curriculum. Thus, a student weaves a degree from these Threads. Students are not forced to make Thread decisions very early in their academic careers; however, they may if they want. We define the Threads so they are flexible enough to allow for a variety of technical and creative experiences. Threads are coherent enough that students develop computing skills even if their focus shifts as they go along.  The CS curriculum also offers opportunities in undergraduate research and international study. In addition to the standard four-year plan, a five-year cooperative plan is offered for students who wish to combine their academic education with industry experience.  The undergraduate program requires:  a total of 124 credit hours for graduation, plus a two-hour Wellness course. With the exception of free electives, all Bachelor of Science degree coursework must be taken on a letter-grade basis. Up to six hours of free electives may be taken on a pass/fail basis. No 1000- or 2000-level HPS hours or precalculus hours (currently MATH\u00a01113) may be used as free electives. No course that covers the same material as other courses in a student's plan of study can be used as a free elective. All required CS courses, whether Thread or non-Thread, must be completed with a C or better to be counted toward degree requirements. All courses listed as required for a Thread, whether CS or non-CS, must be completed with a C or better to be counted toward degree requirements. The College of Computing Defines Nine Threads  A Thread provides an intuitive, flexible, and mutually strengthening set of courses that allows a student to craft a distinctive future in an area that is certain to have societal value in the emerging world. A Thread provides a skill and credential basis that allows graduates to create value in ways beyond what would be possible with only a narrowly focused tool set.  Choose any two threads to create your own path and special variation on an area of study.  Computing and Cybersecurity and Privacy: building security and privacy in computing systems to fortify them against attacks from malicious actors and other disruptions. Computing and Devices: creating devices embedded in physical objects that interact in the physical world Computing and Information Internetworks: representing, transforming, transmitting, and presenting information Computing and Intelligence: building top-to-bottom models of human-level intelligence Computing and Media: building systems in order to exploit computing's abilities to provide creative outlets Computing and Modeling - Simulation: representing natural and physical processes Computing and People: designing, building, and evaluating systems that treat the human as a central component Computing and Systems and Architecture : creating computer architectures, systems, and languages Computing and Theory: theoretical foundations underlying a wide range of computing disciplines  Threads\u2122 are defined as partial paths through the course offerings of the Institute.

    "overview": "Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with Threads  Focus: building on a base of fundamentals in programming and computational theory to provide a solid foundation of knowledge and skills for applying digital processes effectively to issues of broad interest in a global society.  The undergraduate degree in computer science (CS) offered by the College of Computing provides a solid foundation of knowledge and skills for applying digital processes effectively to issues of broad interest in a global society. Our program is based on a unique concept, Threads\u2122 , a significant College of Computing innovation in undergraduate CS education. The curriculum builds on a base of fundamentals in programming and computational theory to allow each student the opportunity to explore a variety of computing paths in depth. There are nine Threads, each providing a focused journey through a broad spectrum of course offerings at Georgia Tech in preparation for a distinctive future in a changing and interconnected world. Each student selects two Threads to fulfill the requirements for an accredited Bachelor of Science degree in computer science. It is at the intersection of the two paths that the unique synergistic value of this educational experience is realized. Graduates will leave the College of Computing fully aware of the limitless potential of their dynamic discipline and be able to adapt and continuously add value to society throughout their careers.  The Threads\u2122 represent partial paths through the curriculum. Thus, a student weaves a degree from these Threads. Students are not forced to make Thread decisions very early in their academic careers; however, they may if they want. We define the Threads so they are flexible enough to allow for a variety of technical and creative experiences. Threads are coherent enough that students develop computing skills even if their focus shifts as they go along.  The CS curriculum also offers opportunities in undergraduate research and international study. In addition to the standard four-year plan, a five-year cooperative plan is offered for students who wish to combine their academic education with industry experience.  The undergraduate program requires:  a total of 124 credit hours for graduation, plus a two-hour Wellness course. With the exception of free electives, all Bachelor of Science degree coursework must be taken on a letter-grade basis. Up to six hours of free electives may be taken on a pass/fail basis. No 1000- or 2000-level HPS hours or precalculus hours (currently MATH\u00a01113) may be used as free electives. No course that covers the same material as other courses in a student's plan of study can be used as a free elective. All required CS courses, whether Thread or non-Thread, must be completed with a C or better to be counted toward degree requirements. All courses listed as required for a Thread, whether CS or non-CS, must be completed with a C or better to be counted toward degree requirements. The College of Computing Defines Nine Threads  A Thread provides an intuitive, flexible, and mutually strengthening set of courses that allows a student to craft a distinctive future in an area that is certain to have societal value in the emerging world. A Thread provides a skill and credential basis that allows graduates to create value in ways beyond what would be possible with only a narrowly focused tool set.  Choose any two threads to create your own path and special variation on an area of study.  Computing and Cybersecurity and Privacy: building security and privacy in computing systems to fortify them against attacks from malicious actors and other disruptions. Computing and Devices: creating devices embedded in physical objects that interact in the physical world Computing and Information Internetworks: representing, transforming, transmitting, and presenting information Computing and Intelligence: building top-to-bottom models of human-level intelligence Computing and Media: building systems in order to exploit computing's abilities to provide creative outlets Computing and Modeling - Simulation: representing natural and physical processes Computing and People: designing, building, and evaluating systems that treat the human as a central component Computing and Systems and Architecture : creating computer architectures, systems, and languages Computing and Theory: theoretical foundations underlying a wide range of computing disciplines  Threads\u2122 are defined as partial paths through the course offerings of the Institute. Students constructs their own personalized computer science degree by weaving through two Threads\u2122. Each Thread\u2122 is about 2/3 of a degree, but with Thread\u2122 arithmetic, since there's so much overlap, 2/3 + 2/3 = 1.

    "overview": "The program for the Master of Science in Computer Science (MSCS) prepares students for more highly productive careers in industry. Graduates receive the MSCS for completing one of three options in the program as described in this section. Students may apply to the program if they possess a bachelor's degree in computer science from an accredited institution. Students without a bachelor's degree in computer science are encouraged to apply as well, with the understanding that they will be required to complete remedial coursework appropriate to their background in addition to the requirements of the MSCS degree. All applicants are evaluated according to their prior academic record, scores on the Graduate Record Examination, a personal statement, and letters of recommendation. Applicants are selected for fall semester admission only. The application deadline is February 1. However, all applicants are encouraged to apply as early as possible because the selection process may begin well before the deadline.  Students entering the program must demonstrate a core competency in computing equivalent to undergraduate-level courses in the following areas:  systems, design and analysis of algorithms, formal languages and automata theory, databases, networking and communications, computer architecture, and human-computer interaction.  This requirement can be satisfied by having taken undergraduate courses as a part of an undergraduate degree, taking remedial courses in the MS CS program, or by examination. Students may specialize in areas of their choice. Every student must complete at least one specialization as a part of their degree program. The current eleven specialization areas are:  Computer Graphics, Computing Systems  High-Performance Computing, Human-Computer Interaction  Interactive Intelligence  Machine Learning  Modeling and Simulations  Scientific Computing  Social Computing  Visual Analytics.  A student who is enrolled in another graduate program of the Institute may pursue an MSCS while that student is also pursuing their degree in the other major. To be granted permission to pursue the MSCS, a student must submit to the MS program coordinator of the College of Computing the material required for admission to the MSCS program. This includes transcripts, letters of recommendation, and GRE General Test. If the student is approved by the College to pursue the MSCS, the student will be notified in writing. At no time will a student outside the College be allowed to pursue a concurrent degree without prior permission of the MS program coordinator of the College of Computing.  A student enrolled in the MS degree program in computer science who wishes to be admitted to the PhD program in computer science should apply via the same process as external students. It is expected that such a student will have at least two letters of recommendation from College of Computing faculty.  For more information about the MS CS program, visit www.cc.gatech.edu.",

The curriculum is designed to provide students with fundamental knowledge of scientific disciplines and engineering principles that are used to address emerging environmental issues such as sustainable air, water, and land resources; human health; and environmental restoration. In the first and second years, students take courses in physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, English composition, and introductory engineering. The third year incorporates advanced engineering topics, including solid and fluid mechanics, thermodynamics, and laboratories in engineering materials, hydraulic engineering, and environmental monitoring and process engineering. The fourth year is elective based, allowing students to select courses from specific focus areas, including biological processes, sustainability, air pollution, and water resources, in addition to technical and design electives. A senior-level capstone design course serves to integrate principles from a range of disciplines. The curriculum is intended to provide students with the flexibility to develop tailored sequences of electives to meet individual education and career objectives, while ensuring a comprehensive engineering design experience.  Prerequisites and Other Requirements  Students must satisfy all prerequisites for a particular course. In addition to Institute academic requirements for graduation with a BS degree, the following requirements must be satisfied for the BS EnvE:  A letter grade of C or better must be earned in Course List Code\tTitle\tCredit Hours PHYS\u00a02211\tIntroductory Physics I\t4 MATH\u00a01551\tDifferential Calculus\t2 MATH\u00a01552\tIntegral Calculus\t4 MATH\u00a01553\tIntroduction to Linear Algebra\t2 MATH\u00a01554\tLinear Algebra\t4 MATH\u00a02552\tDifferential Equations\t4 CHEM\u00a01310\tPrinciples of General Chemistry for Engineers\t4 COE\u00a02001\tStatics\t2 The total number of quality points earned in CEE courses used to satisfy degree requirements must be at least twice the number of credit hours in those courses.

The undergraduate program prepares students for a career in design practice as well as for graduate education in industrial design and in other related fields. The School of Industrial Design at Georgia Tech offers the only industrial design degree program in the University System of Georgia.  Industrial design is the professional practice of creating products that enhance the function, usability, value, and appearance of products, services, systems, and experiences\u00a0with the goal of benefiting the user, manufacturer, community, and the environment. Industrial design education prepares students to design systems and tangible artifacts including, consumer and recreational products, business and industrial products, medical and computer equipment, transportation and environments, as well as user experience and interfaces. Both generalist and specialist, industrial designers tend to be part artist, part entrepreneur, and part engineer.  Cross-disciplinary education is the primary focus of the four-year industrial design program. The university education provides:  an understanding of the arts (liberal and visual arts), technology (engineering and sciences), humanities (sociology and psychology), and management (marketing and branding), a collaborative and shared education through an emphasis on the design studio, and an opportunity to periodically participate in real-life design projects through sponsored studio projects. \u00a0  The undergraduate program offers a well-rounded course of study with an emphasis on critical thinking, basic design, design skills, and design communication. There are 6 industrial design studios after the first-year suite of introductory design classes. The industrial design studios focus on a sequential learning path which begins with form making to product design to post design that involves development and manufacturing. Design projects stress developing a broad education through an exposure to academic and professional considerations. The School encourages students to develop a diverse background in order to expand individual talents and respond to emerging opportunities in the field. Faculty members are scholars and design practitioners, giving students the opportunity to learn about both.  The\u00a0faculty reserves the right to refuse credit for any project executed outside the precincts of the College or otherwise executed without proper coordination with the instructor.  Grade Requirements  All required industrial design courses must be completed with a grade of C or higher. A student may not enter a more advanced studio design course until this requirement is met; students with such academic deficiencies may be required to delay their studies for one year. Studio design courses must be taken in sequence beginning fall semester. A maximum of 9 credit hours may be taken on a pass/fail basis. Only courses taken as free electives in the undergraduate curriculum maybe taken for pass/fail credit.

    "overview": "Industrial design is the professional service of creating and developing concepts and specifications that optimize the function, value, and appearance of products and systems for the mutual benefit of both user and manufacturer. The industrial designer's work touches all of our lives in the form of home products and furnishings, communication devices, healthcare equipment, rehabilitation technologies, and a myriad of other consumer and industrial products and services. While giving form to the efforts of industry, the designer is at the same time a consumer advocate, providing the humanizing link between technology and people. As such, the industrial designer's central responsibilities include fitting the artifact, system, or service to the person through considering appropriate aesthetics and ergonomics, technical processes, requirements for manufacture, marketing opportunities, and economic constraints.  At the graduate-level, Georgia Tech\u2019s Master\u2019s of Industrial Design (MID) focuses on an inclusive design approach that is dedicated to the creation and development of products, systems, services and environments that are usable by all segments of the population. With the growing diversity of the population, inclusive design is becoming increasingly important to designers of tomorrow to ensure that design is responsive to the individual and collective needs of all people.  Capitalizing on Georgia Tech\u2019s rich traditions in technology and research, the MID program stresses a user-centered design process and evidence-based design practice that offers students unique opportunities to explore the design of new and existing technologies. Faculty members, who are practicing designers and experts in their fields, maintain active research programs in tangible products within communication technologies, enabling environments, supportive product systems, rehabilitation technologies, and healthcare systems technologies.  The Georgia Tech MID program offers a well-rounded course of study with early emphasis on exercising design principles and developing project-based design skills. Design projects stress realistic design situations, where students can have the opportunity to be involved in sponsored and/or funded projects. Within this model, the program encourages students to expand individual disciplinary talents and respond to changing opportunities in the field.  Students who have an undergraduate degree in industrial design from an undergraduate ID program similar to Georgia Tech\u2019s can complete a two-year program consisting of 48 graduate credits.  Students who do not have an undergraduate degree in industrial design will need to successfully complete an additional 28 undergraduate industrial design credits, which at a minimum includes one year of undergraduate industrial design studios, Advanced Sketching, History of Industrial Design, Industrial Design Computing I and II, and Professional ID Practices. These classes are the minimum requirements students with a previous degree other than industrial design need before proceeding into the graduate-level studios and coursework.  All graduate students will be reviewed each year for satisfactory progress. Credit toward the MID degree will be granted for courses in which a grade of C or higher is earned.

Three of these programs are interdisciplinary:  MS QCF (joint with School of Mathematics, College of Business), MS STAT (joint with School of Mathematics) and MS SCE (joint with College of Computing, School of Mathematics).  All proposed master's degree programs require thirty semester credit hours with the exception of MS IL and MS QCF (thirty-six credit hours) and MS HS (thirty-three credit hours). None of these MS programs contains a thesis option.  A student seeking a master's degree must have a bachelor's degree and typically one earned in engineering, science, mathematics, or some other field that provides an adequate background for the successful completion of one of ISyE's programs. Students having backgrounds from unaccredited degree programs or in programs that are found lacking in relative substance can expect to first take preliminary coursework in order to elevate their preparation to the level required. The prerequisite coursework for the various master's degrees includes strong performance in probability, statistics, linear algebra, and calculus.  Every MS curriculum is based on core classes offered from the School of ISyE, as well as electives offered by ISyE and other Georgia Tech schools in engineering and science. The MS SCE, MS QCF, and MS IL are professional degree programs with separate curriculums from the other regular MS degrees.  MS Human-Integrated Systems",

    "overview": "The materials science and engineering undergraduate program offers a BS degree in Materials Science and Engineering with concentrations in Polymer and Fiber materials, Structural and Functional materials and Biomaterials. This versatile degree combines instruction in the fundamentals of ceramic, metallurgy, and polymer and fiber science and engineering with specialized knowledge and skills, including nano-, bio-, composite, electronic, and optical and magnetic materials. Freshmen and sophomores study basic chemistry, physics, mathematics, and engineering science and are introduced to the fundamental aspects of materials. Two English courses taken in the freshman year provide the foundation for further instruction in communications that is integrated throughout the curriculum. Juniors and seniors take courses in the engineering and science of materials including the details of materials processing, structure, and properties. The curriculum culminates in a two-course senior design sequence in which students work in teams to design a material, component, or process using previously learned skills and knowledge.  Five concentration related courses provide flexibility that allow students in their junior-senior years to focus in a particular area of materials. Five hours of free electives allows students to further specialize or pursue other interests. Courses in the humanities/fine arts and social sciences ensure that graduates appreciate the role of engineering in today's global society.

The basis of the Bachelor of Science in Physics degree is the traditional preparation of a student for graduate study in physics.  Each of the baccalaureate programs contains the following:  courses needed to meet general institutional degree requirements; a core of technical courses intended to give a strong background in mathematics and the physical principles of mechanics, electricity and magnetism, thermodynamics, and the quantum theory that governs physical phenomena at the microscopic level of molecules, atoms, and nuclei; technical electives that enable the student to explore areas of their choice in greater depth; courses involving undergraduate research, and free electives, about fifteen percent of the total hours, which may be employed to schedule additional technical or nontechnical courses.  The considerable flexibility inherent in the physics curricula is advantageous to students who wish to work out individual programs of study.

    "overview": "Doctor of Philosophy with a major in Psychology  All PhD programs must incorporate a standard set of Requirements for the Doctoral Degree.  OVERVIEW  The Doctoral program provides the student with specialized coursework and opportunities for research in Cognition and Brain Science, Cognitive Aging Psychology, Engineering Psychology Industrial/Organizational Psychology, or Quantitative Psychology. Each curriculum includes individualized study and research with a strong foundation in general experimental psychology as a basis for this specialization. The goal of the School of Psychology, reflected in the structure of the program described within this handbook, is to provide an academic environment in which the Ph.D. degree will be completed in a reasonable amount of time.  REQUIRED COURSEWORK FOR THE DOCTORAL DEGREE PROGRAMS  Doctor of Philosophy with a Major in Psychology (Specialization in Cognition and Brain Science)  The Cognitive and Brain Science specialty area for the Psychology Ph.D. program trains students to understand diverse aspects of cognition. Students learn about theories of cognitive phenomena and the neurobiological bases of cognition and behavior. Students study the major methods used to measure various components of cognition. These components include attention, sensation and perception, working memory, episodic memory, cognitive control, language, metacognition, spatial cognition, and problem-solving. Faculty research interests include these areas of cognition as they exist in humans and aspects of comparative psychology (animal behavior and cognition). Some faculty members' research interests include human cognitive neuroscience, measuring brain activity during cognition with electrophysiological or imaging techniques in persons with or without neurological dysfunction. The program is closely connected to faculty with interests in the Cognitive Aging program, including understanding the effects of aging on cognitive mechanisms and how aging influences neural functioning and cognition.

Doctor of Philosophy with a Major in Psychology (Specialization in Cognitive Aging)  The Cognitive Aging specialty area in the Psychology PhD program emphasizes training students about cognition in adulthood. Students gain an understanding of the biological, psychological, and social aspects of aging as they relate to cognitive development over the adult life span. Areas of interest of the faculty include age differences and age changes in basic cognitive mechanisms (such as working memory, episodic memory, attention, speed of processing, and language), higher-order cognition (including adult intellectual development), and practical and contextual aspects of cognition (such as knowledge acquisition, skill development, everyday problem solving, metacognition, emotion regulation, and social cognition). The program is closely connected to faculty with interests in human factors and aging (in the Engineering Psychology program), cognitive neuroscience of aging (in the Cognitive and Brain Sciences program), and aging issues in work and careers (in the Industrial/Organizational Psychology program).

The BS PP core courses provide students with the broad political, economic, and philosophical foundations of thought pertinent to public policy, a base of rigorous quantitative and qualitative analytical approaches, and a solid understanding of the political and social dynamics that structure policy debates and policy outcomes.  The curriculum moves from disciplinary foundations (in politics, economics, philosophy, and organization theory) to methods of research and data analysis, and to detailed studies of particular policy problems. \u00a0Students choose two clusters in environment and energy policy, science and technology policy, social and urban policy, philosophy, or politics and policy, and can select electives in additional areas such as information and telecommunication policy, bioengineering and ethics, and regional development policy. All students have opportunities for internships, research, and study abroad or exchange programs. \u00a0The BS PP program culminates in a senior-year two-semester capstone \"task force\" in which students work in teams with outside clients (e.g., Centers for Disease Control, Marcus Autism Center, Multiple Sclerosis Society, Atlanta Food Bank) on actual policy problems.  The program's emphasis on the development of problem-solving and analytical skills constitutes a strong comparative advantage for BS PP graduates, many of whom move on to law school, management consulting, public sector policy analysis, or nonprofit management.",

The QBioS program is designed to provide Ph.D. graduates with the skills and expert knowledge necessary to move directly into academia, industry and/or government, where they can apply their specific domain expertise and broadly relevant modeling tools.  The Ph.D. program in Quantitative Biosciences is offered by the College of Sciences. Students select a home school within the College of Sciences and can select a thesis advisor from the entire list of program faculty, irrespective of home school. QBioS Ph.D. students will pursue thesis research across a broad range of research themes spanning molecular and cellular systems, chemical biology, behavior and applied physiology, ecology, evolution and earth systems. The diverse faculty will ensure that students are prepared for quantitative challenges in the biosciences, whether in the analysis of big data, analysis of complex models, and iterative design of theory and experiments.  We welcome applications from high-quality undergraduate students, who are:  trained in the physical sciences (e.g., physics, earth systems and chemistry), mathematics, computer science, and engineering, who would like to transition to a career focusing on interface research in the biosciences; trained in the biosciences (e.g., integrative biology, physiology, ecology, evolution, neuroscience, biochemistry, molecular & cellular biology) with particular strengths and interests in quantitative analysis and modeling.  In addition, students with Masters degrees in those thematic areas are strongly encouraged to apply.  For more information visit\u00a0qbios.gatech.edu",
